 * Amogh is an Antiquarian, The person who collects antiques.
He found a rear keyboard which has following keys,
Keys are 'N', 'S', 'C' and 'P'

1st Key - 'N': Print one character 'N' on Console.
2nd Key - 'S': Select the whole Console.
3rd Key - 'C': Copy selected content to buffer.
4th Key - 'P': Print the buffer on Console, and append it after what has 
already been printed.

Now, your task is to find out maximum numbers of 'N's you can print
after K keystrokes . 

Input Format:
-------------
An integer K

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, maximum numbers of 'N's you can print.


Sample Input-1:
-------------------
3

Sample Output-1:
-------------------- 
3

Explanation: 
---------------
We can print at most get 3 N's on console by pressing following key sequence:
N, N, N



Sample Input-2:
-------------------
7

Sample Output-2:
---------------------
9

Explanation: 
---------------
We can print at most get 9 N's on console by pressing following key sequence:
N, N, N, S, C, P, P
