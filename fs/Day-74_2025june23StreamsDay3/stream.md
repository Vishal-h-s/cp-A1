## some more common stream operations

foreach: 
iterates over elements
lambda has one argument return value is ignored
terminal operation
can also pass method references

map: applies a function to each element
filter: removes elements that dobnt satisfy a custom rule
sorted: sorts elements
limit: returns the first n elements 
distinct: removes duplicates
collect: gets elements out of the stream once were done(terminal operation)

collect(reductions):
reducer created with Collectors.reducing(0, (acc, cur)->acc+cur);
accepts initial accumulator and a function with 2 params: current value of acc and current stream value

count: counts all elements in a stream(terminal)
skip: gets rid of first n elements
findFirst: gets first stream element wrapped in optional (terminal)
toArray: return elements as an array(terminal)
flatMap: flatten the data structure (e.g.on stream consisting of lists)
peek: do something with each item (like forEach, but not terminal)






## A Java Stream is intrinsically linked to its source. It represents a sequence of elements from a data-providing source, such as a Collection, array, generator function, or I/O channel.
However, it is important to understand that a Stream does not store the elements itself; it is a pipeline for processing elements from the source. This linkage means: 
- Lazy Evaluation:
    Operations on a stream are not performed immediately when defined. Instead, they are executed only when a terminal operation (like collect(), forEach(), or count()) is invoked, and elements are consumed from the source only as needed.
- Single Use:
    A stream can be consumed only once. After a terminal operation is performed, the stream is considered consumed and cannot be reused. Attempting to operate on a consumed stream will result in an IllegalStateException.
- No Modification of Source:
    Stream operations are designed to be functional and do not modify the original source data. They produce a new stream or a result based on the transformations applied to the elements.



#### Here are the key Stream methods you should know:

### 1. Creation Methods
```java
// From Collection
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
Stream<String> stream = list.stream();

// From array
String[] arr = {"a", "b", "c"};
Stream<String> stream = Arrays.stream(arr);

// Direct creation
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("a", "b", "c");
```

### 2. Intermediate Operations
```java
// Filter
.filter(x -> condition)

// Map
.map(x -> transformation)
.mapToInt(x -> intValue)
.mapToDouble(x -> doubleValue)

// Sorted
.sorted()
.sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())

// Distinct
.distinct()

// Peek (debugging)
.peek(x -> System.out.println(x))

// Skip/Limit
.skip(n)
.limit(n)
```

### 3. Terminal Operations
```java
// Collection operations
.collect(Collectors.toList())
.collect(Collectors.toSet())
.collect(Collectors.toMap(k -> key, v -> value))

// Reduction operations
.reduce(0, (a,b) -> a + b)
.count()
.sum() // for numeric streams
.average() // returns OptionalDouble
.min()
.max()

// Match operations
.anyMatch(predicate)
.allMatch(predicate)
.noneMatch(predicate)

// Find operations
.findFirst()
.findAny()

// ForEach
.forEach(action)
```

### 4. Specialized Streams
```java
// IntStream, DoubleStream, LongStream
IntStream.range(1, 5)
IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5)

// Parallel streams
list.parallelStream()
stream.parallel()
```

### 5. Common Collectors
```java
// Collecting
.collect(Collectors.joining(", "))
.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(classifier))
.collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(predicate))
.collect(Collectors.summarizingInt(mapper))
```

Remember:
- Streams can only be used once
- Intermediate operations are lazy
- Terminal operations are eager
- Streams don't modify the original data source









## Collectors.groupingBy(classifier)
``>
- Groups elements using the classifier.
- Uses a `HashMap` and collects into `List<T>` by default.

ðŸ“¦ **Return Type:**  
`Map<K, List<T>>`

---

### âœ… 2. Two-Argument Version:
```java
Collectors.groupingBy(classifier, downstreamCollector)
```
- Groups elements using the classifier.
- Still uses a `HashMap`.
- Applies a custom downstream collector (like `counting()`, `toSet()`, etc.)

ðŸ“¦ **Return Type:**  
`Map<K, D>`, where `D` is the result of the downstream collector.

---

### âœ… 3. Three-Argument Version:
```java
Collectors.groupingBy(classifier, mapFactory, downstreamCollector)
```
- Full control:
  - How to group (classifier)
  - What kind of `Map` to use (`LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`, etc.)
  - How to collect the grouped values (`counting`, `mapping`, `toSet`, etc.)

ðŸ“¦ **Return Type:**  
`M<K, D>`, where `M` is the `Map` implementation (e.g., `TreeMap<K, Set<T>>`)

---

## ðŸ”§ Example with 3 Args:
```java
Map<String, Long> freq = words.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
        word -> word,
        LinkedHashMap::new,
        Collectors.counting()
    ));
```

## collectors
ðŸ”¹ Common Downstream Collectors

You can combine groupingBy with:
Collector	What it Does
Collectors.counting()	Count elements in each group
Collectors.toSet()	Collect group values as Set<T>
Collectors.mapping()	Map and collect inner values
Collectors.summingInt()	Sum values in each group
Collectors.averagingInt()	Get average of values per group
Collectors.reducing()	Perform custom reduction in groups
Collectors.collectingAndThen()	Post-process after collection

ðŸ§  When to Use

Use Collectors.groupingBy() when:

    You want to categorize stream elements.

    You want to count, sum, or transform items within each group.

    You need custom groupings and data shaping.

ðŸ›  Tips

    Use .entrySet().stream() to process grouped maps.

    Use LinkedHashMap if insertion order matters.

    Use TreeMap for sorted keys.
